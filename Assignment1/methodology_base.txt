Methodology used in improving the conversion rate for the area estimation of the mandelbrot set.

The basic idea was to concentrate more on the areas where we are not sure whether they are part of the set or not.
For this purpose we devised a subspacing algorithm, taking into account the first 2**n samples and determining 
if the subspace contains only samples that are in the set or out only samples that are out of the set.
In that case future samples will less likely be taken out of that area. this is supposed to increase 
precision of the result.
Also if the area only contains points in the mandelbrot set, future samples in that area will go through fewer 
iterations to confirm whether they are in the set or not, to further increase the accuracy as well.
The resulting subareas will be added to the total area by their relative size.
