Task: Mandelbrot set

Develop a methode to improve the convergence rate of the monte carlo approach.



definately: 
-run 20 times with new seeds for hypothesis testing


assume the area to be known(1.506484(+- 0.000004 with 95%)(A Statistical Investigation of the Area of the Mandelbrot Set(Mitchell-2001)))
"self adapting gradient descent" approach 
estimate the gain(precision and accuracy) by increasing one size, either samples or iterations with the requirement being that
the "true value"(compare mitchel) should lie in the 95 percentile of the experiment.
