what we have:
-for ortogonal sampling and latin hypercube as well as the strategic sampling method
	variance plot
	accuracy plot

-theory
	monte carlo method
	prediction of mandelbrot area
	othogonal / latin hypercube sampling 
	accuracy vs precision


what we still need


-for the strategic sampling:
	hypothesis testing


run code for orthogonal sampling vs strategic sampling
show improved runtime and improved precision with equal accuracy
